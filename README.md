Build a simple website that consists of a home page that links to a few recipes. 
Home page - heading, title, potenitally a food image.
linked pages - use ordered lists, headings, bold, italic, pictures, link back to home page, potentially link to other recipes.

The skill I hope to demonstrate is a basic understanding of different types of elements that can be used in HTML.
